# The number_group function should return "Positive" if the number received is positive,
# "Negative" if it's negative, and "Zero" if it's 0. Can you fill in the gaps to make that happen?

# for multiple condition check, we use elif, it only executable when if statement is false, go down one by one
# if every elif is false sequentially


def number_group(number):
  if number > 0:
     return "Positive"
  elif number < 0:
    return "Negative"
  else:
    return "Zero"
    
  print(number_group(10)) # Should be Positive
  print(number_group(0))  # Should be Zero
  print(number_group(-5)) # Should be Negative 
  
  
  run:
  Here is your output
  Positive
  Zero
  Negative
